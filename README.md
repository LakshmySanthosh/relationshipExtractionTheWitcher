# Relationship Extraction of The Witcher

Have you ever wondered about the intricate relationships between characters in a book series? How do these connections shape the narrative, and which characters hold the most influence? In this project, we delve into the world of The Witcher to uncover these dynamics through network analysis.

Using data scraped from the Witcher Wiki website with Selenium, we analyze the text versions of The Witcher books to create detailed network graphs. These graphs reveal the complex web of interactions among the characters.

For instance, have you ever noticed how central Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer are to the story? The image below illustrates their prominence, as they appear as large nodes in the network graph. This is because they have the most relationships with other characters, highlighting their critical roles in the narrative.

What about the communities within the story? Do certain characters form distinct groups based on their interactions? By using NetworkX and community detection libraries, we create a community graph that shows clusters of characters who frequently interact with each other. This visualization offers insights into the social structure of The Witcher universe.
